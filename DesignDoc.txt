Nite ... 4 something
Copy right Kali adn cobalt 
Tutorial via a certification process - really fucking cringe but like did I work with the devs lol?
I kinda like the terminal :) 
    - a bit of clicking and 4 categories
        info gather
            I love the progress bars for the fingerprint/scan
        network intrusion
        data forensics
        advanced tools
There are modules at the bottom which provide extra tools like satelites ect
This cert process is shit. A lot of good art but that makes this process grueeeling
*Our tutorial should be forced but allows you to navigate the cli by yourself or use an option tutorial.
God the fucking lack of copy and paste is fucking annoying (I found the objectives in the top right which makes this less toxic)

-t for time and depth by selling time. We could do something were you spend more resources/time to get much better results.

I like the multiple windows option. This allows the user to use a larger variety of options
searching exploits is neat
Foxacid is VERY Neat. Pick cards to match exploit params. "Cringe voice lol"
    This plays into my puzzle idea where the team attempts to obtain different pieces and use it to attack a capstone sever.

Password cracking tool was kinda dumb. Aside from that I like the wordlist decision + time component
Basic Filesystem is neat idea

I am annoyed that I can not do things my way, there is a single correct route to take with not art.
Team resources share for sharing information (but we will likely have a chat)

MITM for actions

They are using VPN's to connect to certain machines. Maybe we need a connect process before certain actions are run? That sounds nice :)

Social Engineering requires a bit of prepwork... maybe nice? maybe annoying

They had a minictf to escelate :)
 - some simple image deduction, some ceaser cipher, ect
